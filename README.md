# Path of Exile 2 - Chicken Bot
This is a bot for Path of Exile 2 that will automatically try to press ESC when the character is about to die from
low health, mana, or shield. It is a simple bot that will try to help you to avoid dying in the game.

## How to start

1. Download package
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the bot with `python main.py`

OR

Download released .exe file

## How to use

1. Launch bot
2. Set your threshold (it depends on what char and build you have) but do not set lower values than ~20% of your summarized source points (hp, mana, shield)
   e.g. my sorc has 1550 HP and 3800 MP (where dmg hits my mana points first). My threshold is 1070 on HP for chicken bot.
   `1550 + 3800 = 5350 -> * 0.2 = 1070`
   
3. Click start
4. Launch game
